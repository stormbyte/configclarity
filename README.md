# ConfigClarity
Browser-based DevOps audit tools. No backend. No signup. Everything runs client-side.
**→ [configclarity.dev](https://configclarity.dev)**

## Tools
| Tool | What it does | URL |
|------|--------------|-----|
| 🕐 **Cron Builder & Visualiser** | Build cron expressions with dropdowns, visualise overlaps on a 24h timeline, detect conflicts, export PNG/crontab | [/](https://configclarity.dev/) |
| 🔒 **SSL Certificate Checker** | Check expiry, chain issues, security headers, and CDN coverage across multiple domains | [/ssl/](https://configclarity.dev/ssl) |
| 🐳 **Docker Compose Auditor** | Scan for hardcoded secrets, missing healthchecks, port collisions, and insecure 0.0.0.0 bindings | [/docker/](https://configclarity.dev/docker) |
| 🛡️ **Firewall Rule Auditor** | Paste ufw status verbose output and audit for high-risk ports, missing default-deny, conflicting rules, and IPv4/IPv6 mismatches | [/firewall/](https://configclarity.dev/firewall) |
| 🔀 **Reverse Proxy Mapper** | Paste nginx.conf or Traefik labels and visualise routing decisions, dangling routes, and missing SSL redirects | [/proxy/](https://configclarity.dev/proxy) |
| 🤖 **robots.txt Validator** | Audit crawl directives, AI bot coverage (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, CCBot), sitemap health, and get a health score | [/robots/](https://configclarity.dev/robots) |

## Why no backend?
You shouldn't have to trust a SaaS tool with your production configs. ConfigClarity runs entirely in your browser — nothing is sent to any server, stored anywhere, or logged.
The architecture is deliberate:
- **SSL checks** use the public crt.sh API, with 800ms sequential delays between domains to respect rate limits
- **Docker, Firewall, Proxy, and robots.txt** audits are pure client-side parsers — your config never leaves the tab
- **Cron visualisation** is computed locally using cronstrue for human-readable descriptions
- No analytics, no tracking, no CDN fingerprinting — the only external resource is JetBrains Mono from Google Fonts

You can verify this yourself: view-source on any tool page. Everything is in one HTML file.

## Stack
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript — no frameworks, no build step
- Deployed on Vercel via vercel.json routing
- Zero npm dependencies in production
- Single-file architecture per tool (each tool is one index.html)

## Design tokens
All tools share a consistent visual language:
```css
--bg:     #0b0d14   /* page background */
--bg2:    #10131f   /* card background */
--bg3:    #161924   /* input background */
--border: #1e2236
--purple: #6c63ff   /* primary accent */
--green:  #22c55e   /* pass / safe */
--orange: #f97316   /* warning / CDN */
--red:    #ef4444   /* critical / fail */
--text:   #e2e4f0
--text2:  #8a8fb5   /* secondary text */
```
Font: JetBrains Mono

## Architecture decisions (frozen)
These were made deliberately and aren't up for debate in PRs:
- **crt.sh for SSL data** — not cert.ist. crt.sh has broader coverage and a stable API
- **Sequential SSL checks, not parallel** — parallel requests at 5+ domains reliably trigger rate limiting
- **800ms delay between domains** — not negotiable, this is what keeps the tool working reliably
- **No &limit= on wildcard queries** — oldest-first ordering makes limits produce wrong results
- **Orange for CDN domains (not red)** — CDN-issued certs are valid; the colour signals "check manually with openssl" not "this is broken"
- **No backend, ever** — the no-backend constraint is the product, not a technical limitation

## Contributing
Bug reports and edge case reports are the most valuable contributions. If a tool gives a wrong result, wrong severity, or misses something obvious — open an issue with the input that caused it.
PRs welcome for new checks on existing tools. New tools are not being added — the suite is intentionally scoped to 6 tools.
